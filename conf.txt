# Configuration file for timetrckr - do not change the name of the file! 
# If you want to use the defaults, just comment out everything.
#
# Required format is: key=value
# where key can be FILE, THRESHOLD, LUNCHSTART, LUNCHSTOP, TIMESEPARATOR
#
# E.g:
# FILE=/Users/giannaks/Dropbox/time2.csv # where to store the output
# THRESHOLD=0 # this threshold is used to avoid false positives, ie you do a small break but it's not lunch
# LUNCHSTART=11:30:00
# LUNCHSTOP=13:30:00
